# How to Test Your Stract Optic

Testing your Stract optic is crucial to ensure it's effectively influencing search results as intended. Here's a step-by-step guide to testing your optic:

## 1. Upload Your Optic

First, upload your optic file to a publicly accessible location. You can use GitHub or any other hosting service that provides raw file access.

## 2. Configure Stract

Go to https://stract.com/settings/optics and enter the URL of your raw optic file.

## 3. Prepare Test Queries

Create a list of search queries relevant to your optic's focus. For example, if your optic is about digital governance, you might use queries like:
- "digital governance tools"
- "online community practices"
- "self-governance in digital age"

## 4. Perform Searches

For each test query:
1. Perform a search on Stract without your optic applied
2. Perform the same search with your optic applied
3. Compare the results

## 5. Analyze the Results

For each search, consider:
- Are the top results more relevant to your optic's focus?
- Are the intended domains (e.g., metagov.org) appearing higher in the results?
- Are irrelevant results being filtered out (if you used `DiscardNonMatching`)?

## 6. Check Rule Effectiveness

For the top results, try to identify which rules in your optic influenced their ranking. This can help you understand if all your rules are working as intended.

## 7. Iterate and Refine

Based on your analysis:
- Adjust boost values if certain aspects are over or under-emphasized
- Add or remove rules as needed
- Refine your match criteria if they're too broad or too narrow

## 8. Document Your Findings

Keep notes on:
- Which queries worked well with your optic
- Any unexpected results
- How you refined your optic based on testing

## 9. Seek Feedback

Share your optic and test results with the Metagov community. Others may provide valuable insights or use cases you hadn't considered.

Remember, creating an effective optic is an iterative process. Regular testing and refinement will help you create an optic that truly enhances the search experience for your area of focus.
