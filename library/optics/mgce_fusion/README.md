# Metagov + Cryptoeconomic Systems Fusion Optic

## Overview
This optic prioritizes content related to Metagov's research areas, digital governance, and community-driven initiatives in the digital age. It aims to surface relevant content for researchers, practitioners, and the Metagov community, with a special emphasis on the connection between Metagov and the Cryptoeconomic Systems publication.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this optic is to create a focused lens for researchers and practitioners interested in the intersection of Metagov's work and cryptoeconomic systems. By boosting content from both Metagov and the Cryptoeconomic Systems journal, this optic aims to facilitate discovery of cutting-edge research and ideas in digital governance and decentralized systems.

## Rules Explanation
1. Boost Metagov and CryptoEcon domains: Significantly increases visibility of content from metagov.org and cryptoeconomicsystems.pubpub.org.
2. Boost digital governance content: Prioritizes discussions about digital and online governance.
3. Boost self-governance in digital contexts: Highlights content about self-governance in digital environments.
4. Boost tools and technologies: Increases visibility of content discussing relevant tools and technologies.
5. Boost community practices: Prioritizes content about community-driven initiatives and practices.
6. Boost institutional innovation: Highlights discussions about new forms of institutions in the digital age.
7. Boost specific research areas: Increases visibility of content related to cryptoeconomics, decentralized systems, and collective intelligence.

## Example Searches

   - Notable observations: More diverse range of sources, including both theoretical discussions and practical implementations.

## Development Process
This optic was developed through an iterative process:
- Started with a focus on Metagov's core concepts
- Expanded to include Cryptoeconomic Systems to broaden the research perspective
- Refined rules to balance between broad concepts (like digital governance) and specific research areas (like cryptoeconomics)
- Adjusted boost values to ensure a good mix of general and specialized content

## Personal Insights
Creating this optic revealed:
- The breadth and interconnectedness of digital governance research
- The importance of balancing academic and practical perspectives in search results
- The challenge of capturing emerging concepts that may not yet be widely used in content

Potential future improvements could include:
- Incorporating more specific emerging technologies or governance models
- Refining the balance between academic and practical content
- Exploring ways to highlight cross-disciplinary research
