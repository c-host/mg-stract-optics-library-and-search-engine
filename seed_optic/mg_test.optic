// Metagov Focus Optic - Step 2

// Overall Optic Behavior:
// This optic is designed to prioritize content related to Metagov and governance in general.
// It works as follows:
// 1. Any result from metagov.org gets a significant boost (Boost(2)).
// 2. Results mentioning "governance" in the title or description get a smaller boost (Boost(1)).
// 3. The Like statement for metagov.org further reinforces preference for this domain.
//
// Rule Interaction:
// - Rules are applied independently, so a result can be boosted by multiple rules.
// - A result from metagov.org mentioning "governance" would get both boosts, significantly increasing its ranking.
// - The Like statement works in conjunction with the rules, potentially giving metagov.org content
//   an additional edge in ranking beyond the explicit boost.
//
// Search Result Impact:
// - Results from metagov.org will appear higher in the search results.
// - Governance-related content from other sources will also be promoted, but to a lesser degree.
// - Other results will maintain their original ranking relative to each other.
// 
// Note: The actual impact may vary based on the search query and available content in the Stract index.
